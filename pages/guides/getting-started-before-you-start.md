# Before You Start

In order to start using Imburse you will require an account. Once an account has been created we will supply you with a **Developer Starter Pack**.

The **Developer Starter Pack** will contain a **public** and **private** key to use the APIs.

Your public and private key will give you API access to perform the following actions:

- Tenant Security Key management
