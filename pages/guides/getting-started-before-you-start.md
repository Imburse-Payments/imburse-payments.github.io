# Before You Start

In order to start using Imburse you will require an Account. Once an Account has been created we will supply you with a **Developer Starter Pack**.

**<mark>Note: If you have not been given your Developer Starter Pack then please contact your account holder.</mark>**

The **Developer Starter Pack** will contain an `Account Security Key` - a **public** / **private** key combination that you will use to authenticate to the API's.

The `Account Security Key` has the following capabilities:

- Manage other Account Security Keys. ie. create, get, delete
- Manage Tenants. ie. create, get, update
- Manage Tenant Security Keys. ie. create, get, delete

**<mark>Important: An Account Security Key is very powerful as it allows the creation of new Tenants and their Security keys. As such they should be kept safe and protected and should never be shared.</mark>**
