# What is a Tenant?
You can consider a Tenant as either a company, department, or organisation.

If you are looking to resell our service you should treat a Tenant within Imburse as a client within your own systems.

Your [Account](/pages/guides/getting-started/what-is-an-account/) can have many Tenants.

**The diagram belows shows the relationship between an Account and its Tenants:**

A Tenant is where you will store configuration for:
- [Schemes](/pages/guides/getting-started/what-is-a-scheme/)
- [Provider Configurations](/pages/guides/getting-started/what-is-a-provider-configuration/)
- [Webhooks](/pages/guides/getting-started/what-is-a-webhook/)
- [Tenant Security Keys](/pages/guides/getting-started/what-are-security-keys/#what-is-a-tenant-security-key)

Tenants do not share information with each other and are a completely self contained, isolated, entity within a multi-tenancy system.
