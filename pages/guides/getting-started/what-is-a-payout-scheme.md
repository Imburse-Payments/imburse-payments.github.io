# What is a Payout Scheme?
A Payout Scheme is an arrangement of [Provider Configurations](/pages/guides/getting-started/what-is-a-provider-configuration) and associated settings that dictate the available r payout options available to your customers.

A Payout Scheme can be configured to concurrently use multiple [Provider Configurations](/pages/guides/getting-started/what-is-a-provider-configuration) such as Tangocard as well as supporting multiple countries and multiple currencies.

When you create a Payout Scheme, you specify the Provider Configurations you want the scheme to use. 

To control the payment options for each country you configure one or more Country Settings.

#### Country Settings
Country Settings give you fine grained, flexible control to tune the payment options for specific countries.

For example, use a Country Setting to configure specific Rewards for customers in a particular country.
