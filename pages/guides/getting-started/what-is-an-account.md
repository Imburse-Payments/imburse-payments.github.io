# What is an Account?
As an organisation signed up to the Imburse Platform you will have been setup with an Account.

This Account is where Imburse will direct any invoices to aswell as using your Account contact details to connect with you.

Your Account is also the administrative root of your Imburse Platform and it will hold one or more of your [Tenants](/pages/guides/getting-started/what-is-a-tenant/).
