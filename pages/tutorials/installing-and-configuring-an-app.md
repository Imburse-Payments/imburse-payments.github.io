# Installing and Configuring an App
Each Tenant will need at least one App integration installed. App integrations allow Imburse to transact with the App provider on your behalf.

See the [App tutorials](/tutorials.html#app-installation-and-configuration-tutorials) for more information on the particular App you would like to install.

For more information on Apps and Marketplace, see the [Apps in Getting Started](/pages/getting-started/apps).
