# Installing and Configuraing an App
Each Tenant will need at least one App integration installed. App integrations allow Imburse to transact with the App provider on your behalf.

See the [App tutorials](#/pages/tutorials) for more information on the particular App you would like to install.

For more information on Apps and Marketplace, see the [Apps in Core Concepts](/pages/guides/core-concepts/#apps).
